# libuds
micro data structure library for C

## Usage
This library is designed for copy-pasting. Each data structure's core file is designed to have no dependencies, with the bare minimum amount of functionality available. 

However, if you want more useful stuff, feel free to include the {data structure}x.h header in your code, too. It has dependencies with some other files, but also more functionality. All sorting routines and higher-order functions are in there.
